## 🧑‍💻 What is Rust GitHub Workflows?

**Rust GitHub Workflows** is a library that allows developers to write GitHub Actions in Rust. It empowers you to automate, manage, and improve your CI/CD pipelines in a type-safe manner.

GitHub Actions is powerful, but writing workflows can sometimes feel repetitive, tricky and frustrating with no strict type-checking. That's where **Rust GitHub Workflows** steps in! 🦾

- 🔥 **Rust-Powered**: Leverage the type-safety of Rust for writing workflows.
- 📦 **Crate-friendly**: Build reusable workflows and publish them as crates.

## 📦 Installation

To use **Rust GitHub Workflows** in your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
gh-workflow = "0.1"
```

Then you can start creating GitHub Actions in your [build.rs](https://github.com/tailcallhq/rust-gh-workflows/blob/main/workspace/gh-workflow-gen/build.rs).

## 👷 Usage

- Simply add a `build.rs` file to your project's root directory.
- Add the following code to generate the GitHub Actions workflow:

```rust
  use rust_gh_workflows::*;

  fn main() {
      // Create a workflow
      let workflow = Workflow::new("CI")
          .permissions(Permissions::read())
          .on(Event::default().push(Push::default().branch("main"))
          .add_job(
              "build",
              Job::new("Build and Test")
                  .add_step(Step::checkout())
                  .add_step(Step::setup_rust().add_toolchain(Toolchain::Stable))
                  .add_step(Step::cargo("test", vec!["--all-features", "--workspace"]))
          )
          .unwrap();

      // Generate the ci.yml
      workflow.generate().unwrap();
  }
  ```

  To view a fully functional example, check out the [build.rs](https://github.com/tailcallhq/rust-gh-workflows/blob/main/workspace/gh-workflow-gen/build.rs) of this project.

- Run `cargo build` to generate the GitHub Actions workflow.

**Workspace**

- The `workspace` directory contains the `gh-workflow-gen` crate, which generates the workflow.

## 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Support for Automated Cargo Releases
- [ ] Improve Type Safety of Nightly Builds
- [ ] Add Rust Docs for the API

## 💡 Why Rust?

Rust provides the perfect combination of speed, safety, and flexibility, making it an ideal choice for writing GitHub Actions. With Rust, you get strong typing, memory safety, and the ability to reuse existing code, which can make your automation scripts more robust and maintainable.
